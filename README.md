# 0.1 - The Beginning

It all began on 07/07/2022 in school. It was in the lunch break (the break is 45 min) in the library on the computers.
DP later was created when i got home. I just wanted something between all the scripts DP.

# 0.2 - The Explaining

DP is for people who want scripts to find their scripts easier. It's a big library full of scripts (not right now) but you can help DP being a big library.
To Help DP being a big library, just put:

```lua
-- this is part of DP. https://github.com/DoggoProgrammer/DPlibrary
```
into your script. To commit your script, please DM me on Discord DoggoProgrammer#3317 and please use 
```
Requesting adding script to library, Script Name: SCRIPTNAME, Script: UPLOADFILE Links: LINKS
```
please make sure to upload a file and enter this text as description. If you don't do so, there are high chances your request is getting declined.
